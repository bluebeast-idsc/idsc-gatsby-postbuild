And unfortunately she was finding very little to be optimistic about.</li>\n<li>My father-in-law’s treatment wound up being a full gastrectomy – meaning stomach removal – followed by chemotherapy and radiation.</li>\n<li>Turns out, yes, you sure can live without a stomach. I know because my father-in-law is still with us today and doing well.  All things considered.\n<ul>\n<li>It’s a struggle, it’s tough for him to keep weight on.</li>\n<li>And if you’re unlucky enough to know cancer at all you know the treatment comes very close to killing you if the disease doesn’t.</li>\n<li>That was the case for my father-in-law as well.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>But my father-in-law is still with us. And he’s NED – no evidence of disease.</li>\n<li>So that gastrointestinal conference that we drove up to San Francisco with our son for… well that was to represent the non-profit that we started as an effort to pay forward the blessing of still having my father-in-law with us.</li>\n<li>Hope for Stomach Cancer is my wife’s full-time job outside of taking care of our son, me and our K9 best friend. I just help with the administrative stuff.</li>\n<li>This was the first opportunity I had to tie Hope for Stomach Cancer into iDriveSoCal.</li>\n<li>I’ll move on in just a moment – first these details:\n<ul>\n<li>Stomach Cancer – like all of them – sucks.</li>\n<li>It’s the 5<sup>th</sup> most common cancer in the world</li>\n<li>It’s the 3<sup>rd</sup> deadliest cancer in the world.</li>\n<li>About 26-thousand cases will be diagnosed in the next 12-months.</li>\n<li>Almost 11-thousand of those cases will result in death within 6-months.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>One of the reasons stomach cancer is so deadly is because it’s often misdiagnosed and almost always caught very late stage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more on stomach cancer go to HopeforStomachCancer.org – that’s all spelled out.  Hope-for-Stomach-Cancer.org.  You can also go to StoCAN.org that will get you to the same place.</p>\n<p>Okay, now that the public service announcement is out the way let’s talk about that drive to San Francisco!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It was my first time making the drive – we took the non-scenic route of Interstate 5.\n<ul>\n<li>It would have been nice to shoot up the coast but we didn’t want to keep our little guy in his baby seat any longer than necessary.</li>\n<li>Plus we were a little pressed for time overall.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>A few things surprised me about the drive:\n<ul>\n<li>It the middle of the state of California is really flat!</li>\n<li>Being from the Midwest I wouldn’t have guessed how flat California can be!\n<ul>\n<li>It was so flat in a few areas that I could have been convinced I wasn’t in California at all but somewhere in Iowa where there happened to be no corn fields.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Another thing that surprised me… or didn’t is all the Tesla charging stations – seemed to be at every stop we made.\n<ul>\n<li>But I think they had a black Model S staged at every stop too… because I never saw anything but a single Model S charging at each location.\n<ul>\n<li>And no one was around the car!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>And he’s what was shocking about San Francisco.\n<ul>\n<li>Let me preface this by stating that we were at a conference with a bunch of doctors and pharmaceutical companies.</li>\n<li>So we were staying at a nice hotel…\n<ul>\n<li>But $77 a night to valet park! Are you kidding me????\n<ul>\n<li>No way – I drove a block and self-parked at a shopping mall. But even that cost me over 30-bucks.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The conference went great.  The ride home was smooth and our little boy did great in the car.  Slept the whole way.</p>\n<p>That’s it for this episode.  California is surprisingly flat in some places.  San Francisco is shockingly expensive and stomach cancer sucks but <a href=\"https://www.hopeforstomachcancer.org\">HopeforStomachCancer.org</a> is there if you need help.</p>\n<p>For iDriveSoCal, I’m Tom Smith.  Thanks for listening.</p>\n","title":"Road Trip for Stomach Cancer – A Journey That’s Personal","date":"Feb 07, 2018","metaDate":"2018-02-07T04:57:53","modified":"2019-09-07 15:58:27","seo":{"metaDesc":"All cancer sucks.
