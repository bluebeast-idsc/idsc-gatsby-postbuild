2017</em></p>\n<p><strong>Tom Smith: </strong>Welcome to iDriveSoCal, the podcast all about mobility from the automotive capital of the United States – Southern California.</p>\n<p>I’m Tom Smith, and in this episode, we’re talking about automated driving.  Specifically, we’re going to identify the different levels of automated driving.</p>\n<p>But before we can do that we need to frame the rather complex issue.</p>\n<p>We hear a lot about driver assisted technology, driverless technologies, robotic cars and the like.</p>\n<p>Personally, I get excited about it all of it and can’t wait for it to get here.</p>\n<p>But the reality is that some automated driving technology – depending on how you look at it, a lot of it actually – is already here.</p>\n<p>The topic can be confusing because of t<u>he definition of the different levels of automation</u> that fall under the umbrella of quote-unquote “automated driving.”</p>\n<p>The topic can also be confusing because there’s many different major industries and organizations dealing with it. And they all have skin in the game so to speak.</p>\n<p>First, you have the for-profit companies that want to bring automated driving technology to you and me – the consumers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>That includes:\n<ul>\n<li>Traditional automotive manufacturers like General Motors.</li>\n<li>Newcomers to automotive manufacturing like Tesla.</li>\n<li>But then also, technology companies like Google’s self-driving arm Waymo and Uber.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then there are the existing Federal government agencies that need to keep us safe by managing their current domains but still accepting, if not embracing, the future.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>These entities include:\n<ul>\n<li>NHTSA – The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</li>\n<li>And the NTSB – The National Transportation Safety Board.\n<ul>\n<li>Both of these organizations were on the scene to investigate a Tesla crash here in LA just a few weeks back.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And then we have the different states in the US deciding what they’re going to allow and not allow.  And that’s even been an issue just from a perspective of testing technology that would ventually be implemented.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For example; Arizona has become the beneficiary of companies moving there to test automated driving tech that California has wanted to move more slowly in allowing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And let’s not forget groups like Consumer Watchdog who we spoke with a couple weeks ago.  They’re basically saying – hey this all is great but let’s proceed with caution because this is a very big hairy issue.</p>\n<p>I might be forgetting something or some-group but you get the point.  The topic of automated driving is big.  There’s a great deal at stake for powerful groups.  And because of that it’s been, and will probably continue to be, quite a fluid situation.</p>\n<p>With all of that in mind there’s one more important group to mention – the Society of Automotive Engineers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You’re probably aware of them, and have been for a long time, you just don’t know it.</li>\n<li>They usually go by their acronym – SAE.\n<ul>\n<li>You’ve seen that around various automotive documentation haven’t you?\n<ul>\n<li>I know I have but didn’t realize it until recently.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anyway, SAE (the Society of Automotive Engineers) is relevant here because just a couple years ago – NHTSA (the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) decided to accept SAE’s definitions of the various levels of automated driving.</p>\n<p>NHTSA has a cool timeline on their website – in case you want to check it out; we have a link to it through this podcast’s post on iDriveSoCal.</p>\n<p>Now NHTSA refers to automated driving technologies as vehicle safety features or safety technology.  And that’s fair –</p>\n<p>all things considered.</p>\n<p>But that can also further confuse the issue.  Just know that the terms can be used interchangeably to refer to technology that will deliver similar outcomes.</p>\n<p>So again, SAE (the Society of Automotive Engineer) has defined six levels of driving automation which NHTSA (the National Highway Transportation Administration) has accepted.</p>\n<p>One last element of confusion – the six levels are labeled Zero through Five because the first level involves no automation at all.</p>\n<p>So here we go with the levels:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Level Zero – It’s referred to as <u>No Automation</u>. You, the driver are executing all tasks of operating the vehicle.</li>\n<li>Level One – Is referred to as <u>Driver Assistance</u>.\n<ul>\n<li>You, the driver are in control but you have the option to have the vehicle execute some tasks of driving.\n<ul>\n<li>The vehicle might steer a little for you or it might brake-or-accelerate for you;</li>\n<li>But it cannot execute both steering and braking-or-accelerating at the same time.\n<ul>\n<li>Basic cruise control, which we’ve had seemingly forever, falls into the Level One category.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Level Two – This is referred to as <u>Partial Automation</u>.\n<ul>\n<li>In this case the vehicle can execute both steering and braking-or-accelerating at the same time.</li>\n<li>But you, the driver, must remain engaged and ready to take-over at any moment.\n<ul>\n<li>Tesla’s auto pilot has been here since 2014.\n<ul>\n<li>And that’s why NHTSA &amp; the NTSB were investigating that recent accident here in LA.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Level Three – Is called <u>Conditional Automation</u>.\n<ul>\n<li>Here the vehicle can drive itself.</li>\n<li>But you, the driver, are still a necessity.</li>\n<li>And, you must be ready to take control at any moment.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Level Four – Is <u>High Automation</u>.\n<ul>\n<li>At this point, the driver is optional.</li>\n<li>But the car will only function in a designated geographic area.\n<ul>\n<li>Like within a city’s limits.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Level Five – The biggie, and the one some say will probably be a long-way off, <u>Full Automation.</u>\n<ul>\n<li>The Driver is optional.</li>\n<li>The vehicle can drive itself anywhere.\n<ul>\n<li>Anywhere is key here.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The reason why many say Level Five is likely a long way off is because of the probable need for infrastructure – across the country – to be able to communicate with (or guide) vehicles.</p>\n<p>Just think of it – every road – across the country has to be marked <u>just-so</u> in order for the Full Automation of Level Five.  Every Interstate, every highway, every street, boulevard, side-street, alley-way, etc.  That is a crazy thought.</p>\n<p>So, going back to Level Four with <u>High Automation</u>.  Waymo has not only been testing this technology in Arizona since last year but they’ve recently been given approval to deploy it to the general public.</p>\n<p>And Waymo says that Phoenix residents will be able to hail driverless Chrysler Pacifica Hybrids by the end of this year.</p>\n<p>Let me restate that so it sinks in.  By the end of this year residents in Phoenix, Arizona will be hailing driverless vehicles to take them around town.</p>\n<p>So, back to the top of this podcast; I stated the reality is that some automated driving technology – depending on how you look at it – is already here.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Well, that’s because it is. And I might just have to take a road trip to Phoenix in a few months to be one of the first to experience what the future holds.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But personally, I’m always going to want to drive.  Always.  I love it – just not the traffic congestion.</p>\n<p>For iDriveSoCal, I’m Tom Smith, thanks for listening.</p>\n","title":"The Levels of Autonomous Driving Explained","date":"Mar 12, 2018","metaDate":"2018-03-12T00:00:45","modified":"2019-04-13 20:52:27","seo":{"metaDesc":"Driver assisted technologies, driverless technology, robotic cars, autonomous vehicles…  If all the robotic driving talk has you confused...","focuskw":"autonomous driving","breadcrumbs":[{"text":"Home","url":"/"},{"text":"Future of Transportation","url":"/category/future-of-mobility/"},{"text":"The Levels of Autonomous Driving Explained","url":"/levels-of-autonomous-driving/"}]},"author":{"node":{"id":"dXNlcjoz","uri":"/author/tom/","name":"Tom Smith"}},"categories":{"nodes":[{"name":"Future of Transportation","uri":"/category/future-of-mobility/"},{"name":"News","uri":"/category/news/"}]},"tags":{"nodes":[]},"post_cta":{"callToAction":null,"callToActionLink":null},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='460'%20height='250'%20viewBox='0%200%20460%20250'%20preserveAspectRatio='none'%3e%3cpath%20d='M0%204v3h461V0H0v4m0%2016v2h461v-5h-99l-231%201L0%2017v3m0%2053v48h7l6%201-6%201H0v103l145-1h145l6-4c27-21%2032-61%2011-88-7-8-10-10-15-10l-5-1c-1-1%200-1%202-1%205%200%204-1-5-5s-15-6-21-6c-4%200-5%200-5-2%200-4%2019%200%2031%207a426%20426%200%200013%207l5%206a64%2064%200%2001-10%2096l-1%201%2082%201h83V24H0v49m253%2056c0%202%201%202%202%202%209-3%2028%209%2034%2020%2015%2026-2%2059-31%2063-6%200-7%201-5%202%201%201%2013-1%2019-4%2030-15%2034-58%206-76-10-6-27-11-25-7m-5%2022l2%201c3%200%2011%204%2014%207%2010%2011%204%2029-9%2033-8%202-9%203-5%203%2020%200%2028-30%2010-41-5-3-12-5-12-3m69%2077c-25%200-28%201-31%203l-3%202h177l1-3v-2H317M1%20230v3l137-1c135%200%20137%200%20141-2l5-2H1v2m-1%2017v3h461v-7H0v4'%20fill='%23d3d3d3'%20fill-rule='evenodd'/%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5c619a6604b3e3ee49231964bf5ec409/24fe0/iDSC043-Featured.png","srcSet":"/static/5c619a6604b3e3ee49231964bf5ec409/24fe0/iDSC043-Featured.png 460w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/5c619a6604b3e3ee49231964bf5ec409/f9fd2/iDSC043-Featured.webp 460w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.5434782608695652}}}}}},"previous":{"uri":"/2018-honda-civic-si-sedan-review/","title":"2018 Honda Civic Si Sedan Review, Features and Photos"},"next":{"uri":"/automobile-driving-museum/","title":"The Automobile Driving Museum – The Collection You Can Ride In!"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoxMDgy","slug":"levels-of-autonomous-driving","nextPage":"cG9zdDoxMDkx","previousPage":"cG9zdDo5NTc="}},"staticQueryHashes":["1140553764","1682016598","2363732042","2795228208","3342902389","3616907257","727386938","848497233"]}

2017</em></p>\n<p><strong>Tom Smith: </strong>Welcome to iDriveSoCal, the podcast all about mobility from the automotive capital of the United States – Southern California.</p>\n<p>I’m Tom Smith, and in this episode, we’re talking about automated driving.  Specifically, we’re going to identify the different levels of automated driving.</p>\n<p>But before we can do that we need to frame the rather complex issue.</p>\n<p>We hear a lot about driver assisted technology, driverless technologies, robotic cars and the like.</p>\n<p>Personally, I get excited about it all of it and can’t wait for it to get here.</p>\n<p>But the reality is that some automated driving technology – depending on how you look at it, a lot of it actually – is already here.</p>\n<p>The topic can be confusing because of t<u>he definition of the different levels of automation</u> that fall under the umbrella of quote-unquote “automated driving.”</p>\n<p>The topic can also be confusing because there’s many different major industries and organizations dealing with it. And they all have skin in the game so to speak.</p>\n<p>First, you have the for-profit companies that want to bring automated driving technology to you and me – the consumers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>That includes:\n<ul>\n<li>Traditional automotive manufacturers like General Motors.</li>\n<li>Newcomers to automotive manufacturing like Tesla.</li>\n<li>But then also, technology companies like Google’s self-driving arm Waymo and Uber.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then there are the existing Federal government agencies that need to keep us safe by managing their current domains but still accepting, if not embracing, the future.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>These entities include:\n<ul>\n<li>NHTSA – The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</li>\n<li>And the NTSB – The National Transportation Safety Board.\n<ul>\n<li>Both of these organizations were on the scene to investigate a Tesla crash here in LA just a few weeks back.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And then we have the different states in the US deciding what they’re going to allow and not allow.  And that’s even been an issue just from a perspective of testing technology that would ventually be implemented.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For example; Arizona has become the beneficiary of companies moving there to test automated driving tech that California has wanted to move more slowly in allowing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And let’s not forget groups like Consumer Watchdog who we spoke with a couple weeks ago.  They’re basically saying – hey this all is great but let’s proceed with caution because this is a very big hairy issue.</p>\n<p>I might be forgetting something or some-group but you get the point.  The topic of automated driving is big.  There’s a great deal at stake for powerful groups.  And because of that it’s been, and will probably continue to be, quite a fluid situation.</p>\n<p>With all of that in mind there’s one more important group to mention – the Society of Automotive Engineers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You’re probably aware of them, and have been for a long time, you just don’t know it.</li>\n<li>They usually go by their acronym – SAE.\n<ul>\n<li>You’ve seen that around various automotive documentation haven’t you?\n<ul>\n<li>I know I have but didn’t realize it until recently.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anyway, SAE (the Society of Automotive Engineers) is relevant here because just a couple years ago – NHTSA (the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) decided to accept SAE’s definitions of the various levels of automated driving.</p>\n<p>NHTSA has a cool timeline on their website – in case you want to check it out; we have a link to it through this podcast’s post on iDriveSoCal.</p>\n<p>Now NHTSA refers to automated driving technologies as vehicle safety features or safety technology.  And that’s fair –</p>\n<p>all things considered.</p>\n<p>But that can also further confuse the issue.  Just know that the terms can be used interchangeably to refer to technology that will deliver similar outcomes.</p>\n<p>So again, SAE (the Society of Automotive Engineer) has defined six levels of driving automation which NHTSA (the National Highway Transportation Administration) has accepted.</p>\n<p>One last element of confusion – the six levels are labeled Zero through Five because the first level involves no automation at all.</p>\n<p>So here we go with the levels:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Level Zero – It’s referred to as <u>No Automation</u>. You, the driver are executing all tasks of operating the vehicle.</li>\n<li>Level One – Is referred to as <u>Driver Assistance</u>.\n<ul>\n<li>You, the driver are in control but you have the option to have the vehicle execute some tasks of driving.\n<ul>\n<li>The vehicle might steer a little for you or it might brake-or-accelerate for you;</li>\n<li>But it cannot execute both steering and braking-or-accelerating at the same time.\n<ul>\n<li>Basic cruise control, which we’ve had seemingly forever, falls into the Level One category.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Level Two – This is referred to as <u>Partial Automation</u>.\n<ul>\n<li>In this case the vehicle can execute both steering and braking-or-accelerating at the same time.</li>\n<li>But you, the driver, must remain engaged and ready to take-over at any moment.\n<ul>\n<li>Tesla’s auto pilot has been here since 2014.\n<ul>\n<li>And that’s why NHTSA &amp; the NTSB were investigating that recent accident here in LA.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Level Three – Is called <u>Conditional Automation</u>.\n<ul>\n<li>Here the vehicle can drive itself.</li>\n<li>But you, the driver, are still a necessity.</li>\n<li>And, you must be ready to take control at any moment.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Level Four – Is <u>High Automation</u>.\n<ul>\n<li>At this point, the driver is optional.</li>\n<li>But the car will only function in a designated geographic area.\n<ul>\n<li>Like within a city’s limits.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Level Five – The biggie, and the one some say will probably be a long-way off, <u>Full Automation.</u>\n<ul>\n<li>The Driver is optional.</li>\n<li>The vehicle can drive itself anywhere.\n<ul>\n<li>Anywhere is key here.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The reason why many say Level Five is likely a long way off is because of the probable need for infrastructure – across the country – to be able to communicate with (or guide) vehicles.</p>\n<p>Just think of it – every road – across the country has to be marked <u>just-so</u> in order for the Full Automation of Level Five.  Every Interstate, every highway, every street, boulevard, side-street, alley-way, etc.  That is a crazy thought.</p>\n<p>So, going back to Level Four with <u>High Automation</u>.  Waymo has not only been testing this technology in Arizona since last year but they’ve recently been given approval to deploy it to the general public.</p>\n<p>And Waymo says that Phoenix residents will be able to hail driverless Chrysler Pacifica Hybrids by the end of this year.</p>\n<p>Let me restate that so it sinks in.  By the end of this year residents in Phoenix, Arizona will be hailing driverless vehicles to take them around town.</p>\n<p>So, back to the top of this podcast; I stated the reality is that some automated driving technology – depending on how you look at it – is already here.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Well, that’s because it is. And I might just have to take a road trip to Phoenix in a few months to be one of the first to experience what the future holds.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But personally, I’m always going to want to drive.  Always.  I love it – just not the traffic congestion.</p>\n<p>For iDriveSoCal, I’m Tom Smith, thanks for listening.</p>\n","title":"The Levels of Autonomous Driving Explained","date":"Mar 12, 2018","metaDate":"2018-03-12T00:00:45","modified":"2019-04-13 20:52:27","seo":{"metaDesc":"Driver assisted technologies, driverless technology, robotic cars, autonomous vehicles…  If all the robotic driving talk has you confused...","focuskw":"autonomous driving","breadcrumbs":[{"text":"Home","url":"/"},{"text":"Future of Transportation","url":"/category/future-of-mobility/"},{"text":"The Levels of Autonomous Driving Explained","url":"/levels-of-autonomous-driving/"}]},"author":{"node":{"id":"dXNlcjoz","uri":"/author/tom/","name":"Tom Smith"}},"categories":{"nodes":[{"name":"Future of Transportation","uri":"/category/future-of-mobility/"},{"name":"News","uri":"/category/news/"}]},"tags":{"nodes":[]},"post_cta":{"callToAction":null,"callToActionLink":null},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='460'%20height='250'%20viewBox='0%200%20460%20250'%20preserveAspectRatio='none'%3e%3cpath%20d='M0%204v3h461V0H0v4m0%2016v2h461v-5h-99l-231%201L0%2017v3m0%2053v48h7l6%201-6%201H0v103l145-1h145l6-4c27-21%2032-61%2011-88-7-8-10-10-15-10l-5-1c-1-1%200-1%202-1%205%200%204-1-5-5s-15-6-21-6c-4%200-5%200-5-2%200-4%2019%200%2031%207a426%20426%200%200013%207l5%206a64%2064%200%2001-10%2096l-1%201%2082%201h83V24H0v49m253%2056c0%202%201%202%202%202%209-3%2028%209%2034%2020%2015%2026-2%2059-31%2063-6%200-7%201-5%202%201%201%2013-1%2019-4%2030-15%2034-58%206-76-10-6-27-11-25-7m-5%2022l2%201c3%200%2011%204%2014%207%2010%2011%204%2029-9%2033-8%202-9%203-5%203%2020%200%2028-30%2010-41-5-3-12-5-12-3m69%2077c-25%200-28%201-31%203l-3%202h177l1-3v-2H317M1%20230v3l137-1c135%200%20137%200%20141-2l5-2H1v2m-1%2017v3h461v-7H0v4'%20fill='%23d3d3d3'%20fill-rule='evenodd'/%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5c619a6604b3e3ee49231964bf5ec409/24fe0/iDSC043-Featured.png","srcSet":"/static/5c619a6604b3e3ee49231964bf5ec409/24fe0/iDSC043-Featured.png 460w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/5c619a6604b3e3ee49231964bf5ec409/f9fd2/iDSC043-Featured.webp 460w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.5434782608695652}}}}}},"previous":{"uri":"/2018-honda-civic-si-sedan-review/","title":"2018 Honda Civic Si Sedan Review, Features and Photos"},"next":{"uri":"/automobile-driving-museum/","title":"The Automobile Driving Museum – The Collection You Can Ride In!"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoxMDgy","slug":"levels-of-autonomous-driving","nextPage":"cG9zdDoxMDkx","previousPage":"cG9zdDo5NTc="}},"staticQueryHashes":["1140553764","1682016598","2363732042","2795228208","3342902389","3616907257","727386938","848497233"]}
